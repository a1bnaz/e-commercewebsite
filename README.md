3/20/25 - so i'm pretty sure i've set up the basics right now. i still need to figure out how to set up the api's and stuff like that. i need to figure out how to get the frontend and the backend to interact with each other. after that i need to set up the react backend. i'm prob going to create a separate repository for the repository, or maybe i can combine it into this one idk how to do that i'l find out later.

>so i'm pretty sure i've set up the basics right now. i still need to figure out how to set up the api's and stuff like that. i need to figure out how to get the frontend and the backend to interact with each other. after that i need to set up the react backend. i'm prob going to create a separate repository for the repository, or maybe i can combine it into this one idk how to do that i'l find out later.

>stopped watching the udemy course because it was too slow paced and will only refer to it when i need to learn something specific. i started working on this project like 2 or 3 days ago and forgot to use this devlog that i created two months ago. originally this repo was going to be used as a demo project until i learned everything and i was going to create a brand new repo for my actual project. but i decided i just want to dive straight in and create my MVP straight off the bat and just learn by doing. it's overwhelming but i'm enjoying the process. the whole point of this project is to create a marketplace that is restricted just for my university. my inspiration for this project came from a youtuber i watch online. but yeah i want to finish this project by the end of summer so that i can actually have something up and running. so far tho its pretty bare bones and the ui is horrible, i've already created the login page, home page, listings page, and i'm starting to work on the my listings page and the logic that runs behind it next coding sesh. but yeah i still almost have no idea what i'm doing but i guess i'll see where this thang takes me.
